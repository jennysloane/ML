# Statistical and Machine Learning

In my lab at UNSW, we have a weekly "modeling" meeting where we come together and chat about stats techniques and/or problems. Recently, we've decided to spend time discussing statistical and machine learning. 

This repository contains material that I've compiled to help lead discussions. I'll post code for different topics that we can go through together. 

Here are 2 books that I think are relevant and extremely useful that will also help to guide our discussions:
  - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani 
  - [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) by Dani Davarro
