Question:

- what is cross validated prediction error?
- is best subset selection the better approach when you have a small number of predictors? or should you always use different methods?

- does it matter the order variables are added in or taken out in stepwise selection?
- subset selection involves 2^p models, but forward stepwise involves 1+p(p+1)/2 models - why this equation?
- footnote page 209: forward and backward stepwise selection performs a "guided" sear over model space, so effectively considers more models...what does this mean?

- page 211 Figure 6.2 - Cp, BIC, adjusted R^2 all result in a different "best" subset of models... so what do you do? this chapter seemed a little overwhelming in terms of options and methods to use 

- ridge regression, do not shrink intercept?
- what is a tuning parameter?

- lasso - figure 6.7 
- I didn't understand the bayesian interpretation section
